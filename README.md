# Matrix Operations App

## Description

This Android app allows users to input the dimensions of two matrices and perform basic matrix operations (addition, subtraction, and multiplication). The app provides an interface for the user to enter matrix dimensions and then navigate to a new activity to input matrix values. Matrix operations are performed using native methods written in C++ for optimized performance.

## Features

- **Navigation**: After validating dimensions, the app navigates to a new activity where the user can input matrix elements.

## Requirements

- **Android Studio**: Make sure you have Android Studio installed with the required SDK and NDK (for native code).
- **Android API Level**: 21 or higher is recommended.
